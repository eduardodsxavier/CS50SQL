It's probably that no particion will have hove more observatian than the others, but every time that you have to make a observation you will need to look in every partition.

## Partitioning by Hour

TODO
It's probably that a particion will have hove more observatian than the others, but observations will be more easy because you its possible to know in where particion is the data.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

TODO
No partition will have more observation than the others, but observations will need to look in every partition if you dont know the value that will be used for the hash value.
